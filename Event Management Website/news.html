They were organized and detail oriented in planning, and insightful as we were making decisions. On the day of the wedding, the calm demeanor helped us to relax, and they were always attentive to whatever concerns we had. Jenn was my go-to person and instant problem-solver and worked well with all the other staff. Elevated Events kept track of the schedule and all the details so that I could interact with the guests and enjoy the evening. They worked hard and seem to truly enjoy what they do. And they do a superb job! We recommend them highly!”

She was available through email,
                                phone, and would be willing to meet and discuss plans. We made a custom plan to help us search for vendors and provided many suggestions who we ended up using. She was a great mediator for some meetings, too that included family members! The week of the wedding was hectic and they are very busy, but took the time to meet and plan out. Jenn and her team will help ease any problems that may arise on the wedding day and take care of it before it ever gets to the bride so that you have nothing to worry about on your big day. She will do everything she can to make your dream wedding turn to reality and she did that for my husband and I. Thank you Elevated Events for making our day beautiful.”

I originally anticipated being able to organize everything for my wedding on my own because I felt like I was fairly good at it. But after things began to quickly pile up and get a little intimidating, I decided to look for a day-of coordinator and was insanely lucky to find Jenn and Janea with Elevated Events. I used their day-of coordinating services because as I worked through planning, I realized there was a lot more to align at the last minute than I originally anticipated. Honestly, these women are absolutely phenomenal at what they do and will bend over backwards for you. These ladies, along with their intern, pulled everything together for me and made sure that my family, friends, wedding party AND my husband and I were very well taken care of on our wedding day. They brought together everything I already had lined up, quickly connected me with amazing people who took care of what I hadn’t done like flowers and ceremony music, and helped my mom and I perfect the final touches on decor at the venue so we could enjoy ourselves on the big day. I was never left wishing I had anything, they were always on top of everything-keeping me hydrated, cool, dry (yeah, they’ll dab your face for you to avoid any makeup smudges!) and happy all day long! We had rain, they had umbrellas. We needed help with our dessert table, they gladly took over. I took one step toward the drink table, there was Janea with a fresh glass of water. They even gladly handle any awkward situations that come up FOR you, so you’re not left feeling like the crazed bridezilla you were trying to avoid becoming :) I can’t believe how much they helped make things better than I ever even dreamed and both wedding party AND guests commented about how much they loved them too. On top of their fantastic service and great eye for detail, they’re very down to earth and easy to get comfortable with. If you find Elevated Events and are considering them among other planners, PICK THEM!!  Elevated Events does a phenomenal job at making you feel calm and relaxed and makes sure that you don’t miss out or get left needing a single thing, I would recommend them a million times to anyone who asked! They have beautiful ideas, excellent attitudes, and are a blast to be around. Big thanks to Jenn and Janea for helping to make my wedding my best day ever! The day wouldn’t have been the same without you!!”

Jenn and I went to school together and reconnected when I saw she was starting her own business. I never thought I would be the type to use a coordinator given I love organization. I knew as soon as we met that this was something I needed. Working full time and planning a wedding (on a budget) is extremely stressful. Jenn from day 1 was absolutely AMAZING. She was so organized and offered so many ideas that tacked onto mine and really seem to understand what I was looking for in my special day. She was always prompt in emails, texts and calls, usually being the one to call me first about something. Leading up to the day she took care of calling/following up with all my vendors. She ran our rehearsal and helped set up our reception room. The day of she took care of the reception centerpiece flowers (another service they offer and they were beautiful). Her and Janea made sure everything was set up and put together for the ceremony so I was just able to get ready and relax that morning. I had the most amazing wedding day and it was so stress free because of these 2. They helped in so many ways and I am so grateful they were there to help. I would recommend them in a heartbeat to any bride that either needs a full service planner or like me, a last minute boost. Thanks again you two, I can never say thank you enough times.”

Everything went incredibly well and Elevated Events played a huge part in that! I would not recommend getting married without a wedding coordinator. We purchased the “day of” wedding package. There are too many moving parts that, as a bride, you do not want to worry about on your wedding day! Janea organized the rehearsal, worked with all of the different venders (we had florist, live musicians, a band and a DJ) - so there was a lot of coordination. Everything went INCREDIBLY well! We couldn’t have been happier with the service!!”

Elevated Events was incredibly helpful and flexible at every step of the process. Elevated Events made our wedding possible. They were understanding but also very diligent during the planning process, making sure that we addressed any potential issues and had any loose ends tied up. During the last week of preparation, and the day itself, they handled all of the coordination flawlessly and everything went off without a problem. We both highly recommend their services.”
